Throughout the pandmeic a lot of people picked up new hobbies and interests, and for me it was watching baseball. I've always been a big sports fan but for some reason 
baseball never really clicked for me but in the 2021 season it's become far and away my favorite sport. Now that I have this new interest I am always looking to engage with other baseball fans and talk about the sport that I now love, but there's just one problem... I lack the 
historical knowledge of the game to be able to talk about pretty much any season before this current one. To solve this issue I decided to bring in another interest of mine, computer programming. I've long been interested in the concept of web scraping but never got the chance to try to use it practically, so I decided this was a perfect time to pick up a new skill while also solving a problem I face in my everyday life. Using the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries I pulled data from MLB.coms table of players and after doing some research on what makes a player truly good I made a formula to return what I think the "best" players of a season are. I hope this tool helps anyone who wants to learn more about the game or just wants to be able to show off to their friends that they know who the best players of 1993, or 1985, or 2015, or any season are. Navigate to the src folder if you want to take a look at the code and pull down this project if you want to give it a try yourslef!
